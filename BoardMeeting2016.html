        Gene Callahan updates board on developments
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Past year was one of hanging on through change over of tenants,
                many repairs.
            <li>Still, company net worth at $40,000.
            <li>But things are looking up: new partner, Ed Debesis.
                <br>Ed brings Pike County presence and many building skills 
                    to company.
                <br>Allows us to:
            <li>Re-open AirBnB business.
                <br>Many customers this fall, and we can go all out in spring.
                <br>Consistently 5-star reviews for service.
        </ul>

        <h3>
            Board members' recommendations
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Anthony</b>: cash flow must improve.
            <li><b>Anthony</b>: establish forward-looking budget.
                <br>Gene will do this.
            <li><b>Jon</b>: establish list of repairs / upgrades needed over next two
                years.
                <br>Gene and Ed will do this.
            <li><b>Jon</b>: assess properties mid-March to get ready for busy season.
                <br>Gene and Ed will do this.
            <li><b>Anthony</b>: add Home away from home to AirBnB as rental source?
                <br>Perhaps not needed: AirBnB can provide full bookings.
            <li><b>Anthony</b> wonders should we go all-out renting this fall to get
                leaf peepers, etc?
                <br>Perhaps not: don't want to rush AirBnB business and get bad
                reviews.
                <br>But next spring it will be good to get professional
                cleaning service that can turn AirBnB property over in one day.
                <br>Worth it to take pressure off of Ed, allow one-day
                turn-arounds.
            <li><b>Anthony</b>: We need to add a board member to be treasurer and
                monitor books.
                <br><b>Possibilities</b>:
                <br>Frank Galeano (established real estate professional)
                <br>Kelli Walsh (but not in NY where board meets)
                <br>James Weber (but not in NY where board meets)
            <li><b>Jon</b>: Set goal that by mid-summer company is running well in the
                black each month.
            <li><b>Jon</b>: Assess net worth twice per year.
            <li><b>Jon</b>: Set goal: Next spring acquire a second house.
            <li><b>Jon</b>: Look at niche properties.
                <br>Example: His friend is making great money having built very
                high-end apartments in town lacking them.
                <br>Question: Does Milford lack/need high-end apartments for,
                say, executives in town for a year or two, and so on?
        </ul>

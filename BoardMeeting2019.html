Year end review
<br />
2019 financial statement
<br />
We took in $12700 through airbnb
<br />
Our cost was $12800
<br />
Airbnb
<br />
Upped minimum stay to 3 nights
<br />
Upped rent by $5
<br />
Eileen: Do we want to bump up to 4? Would this be more difficult for people?
<br />
Gene: short rentals may block people from booking for a longer time; we have 5 bookings already for 2020
<br />
We are sitting on $40k, the next question is how to invest this. Gene has moved into a money market which earns 0.1% interest which is a little more than savings rate.
<br />
Jim Weber has noted that Pennsylvania has passed a new law around airbnb. Each town has a period of town to either conform to that state law or create a new one. Milford has not passed one yet. Will need to look into this law further and assess how this will impact Sawkill. 
<br />
Expected airbnb season after porch build (Callahans will be adding 2nd porch). Approximately Apr 26. 
<br />
Gene: we may open for a few weeks in late March/April weather permitting.
<br />

Investment opportunities - Gene presented the following opportunities
<br />
Buy fixer upper
<br />
Jim Weber has been sending listings. For example, Greentown listings are within our price range.
<br />
Eileen: There is nothing Greentown 
<br />
Build in Gold Key
<br />
Two lots in Gold Key
<br />
Modular construction: cost approx. $100k. Minimum house size is 1200 sq ft. Jim Weber thinks that you could sell a new house in Gold Key for approx. $200k
<br />
Investment in land in Florida
<br />
Jim Weber doesn’t recommend land purchases in Pike County. Market is not active.
<br />
Gene’s brother, Sean Callahan, has been doing this type of investment.
<br />
Right now Sean is buying a lot for $3k with $1k in back taxes. He will put this on the market for $12.5k with expected selling price around $11k. His objective is to get 100% return on each deal.
<br />
To address the risky nature of this investment, Gene suggests only investing a small portion 
<br />
Since Ed is out here, the question is how much availability does he have to work on points 1 and 2.
<br />
Eileen thinks that this is the best opportunity and will allow Sawkill to build up cash for future investments (GoldKey or fixer upper).
<br />
Ed agrees that this is the best opportunity
<br />
Elen agrees that this is the best opportunity
